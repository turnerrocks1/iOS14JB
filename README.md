Run python3 serv.py 
Go to the IP address of your server and type it in on your ios 14.5 or ios 14.6 device or if thats too confusing simply go to my website
turnerrocks1.github.io and it has the live verion
only tested on MacOS Safari 14.1 and iOS 14.5-iOS14.6
this version currently only supports said devices on the line above
but the bug itself is present from iOS 14.1-ios 14.6 or iOS 14.6.1? i forgot honestly....
